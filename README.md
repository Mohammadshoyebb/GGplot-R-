# Employee Details Visualization

This project showcases visualizations of employee data using R and ggplot2. Below is a summary of the visualizations created:

## Scatter Plot

A scatter plot depicting the relationship between employee ID and salary. Each point is represented in blue, emphasizing the distribution of salaries across employees.

## Line Plot

A line plot illustrating the variation of salary with respect to employee age. The plot highlights trends in salary changes as employees age.

## Bar Plots

### Grouped Bar Plot

This plot visualizes the distribution of salaries across different cities where employees work. Each bar represents the salary level, grouped by city, providing insights into regional salary disparities.

### Summary Bar Plot (Mean)

This bar plot displays the average salary for each city, offering a comparative view of salary levels across different geographical locations.

## Distribution Plots

### Density Plot

A density plot showcasing the distribution of salaries across cities. The plot uses varying shades of red to represent the density of salary levels, helping to identify common salary ranges within each city.

### Violin Plot

This plot visualizes the distribution of salaries by age groups using violin plots. The width of the violin indicates the density of salary levels, offering insights into salary distributions across different age demographics.

### Box Plot

A box plot illustrating the distribution of salaries across age groups. This plot uses boxes to show the median, quartiles, and outliers of salary data within each age category.

## Other Plots

### Histogram

A histogram representing the distribution of employee IDs. The plot uses yellow bars with black borders to visually highlight the frequency distribution of employee identifiers.

### Stripchart

This plot displays the distribution of tax amounts across different employee ages using jittered points. It helps visualize the spread and concentration of tax data points within age groups.
